# Barut Chess
 This is a simple chess game that I made to improve myself in Unity. It is not a perfect game, but it is a fun and challenging way to practice your chess skills with a friend on the same device. The game has some known bugs that I did not bother to fix, such as pawns cannot move two squares at the beginning, you have to capture the king to win the game, not just checkmate him, and the chess board may not fit some phone screens. These are minor issues that do not affect the gameplay much. I probably will not fix them in the future. I hope you enjoy playing my simple chess game
